# Advanced Web Application Security Framework

This project is designed to automate the security testing of web applications using the **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)**. The framework automates vulnerability scanning and provides detailed reports, helping you identify security issues in web applications efficiently.

## Overview

The **Advanced Web Application Security Framework** aims to streamline the process of performing security assessments on websites by automating various tasks involved in the vulnerability scanning and analysis process using OWASP ZAP. It is designed to work with test websites to identify common web vulnerabilities, such as:

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
- And more...

## Features

- Automated scanning of web applications using ZAP Proxy.
- Integration with multiple ZAP add-ons for comprehensive security testing.
- Detailed vulnerability reports that highlight issues with severity levels.
- Configurable for custom web applications and testing scenarios.
- Can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines for continuous security testing.

## Prerequisites

Before using this framework, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x** or above
- **OWASP ZAP Proxy** (download from [here](https://www.zaproxy.org/download/))
- **Java** (required for running ZAP)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Advanced-Web-Application-Security-Framework.git
   cd Advanced-Web-Application-Security-Framework
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have OWASP ZAP installed and running on your machine.

## Usage

1. Start the ZAP Proxy in daemon mode:
   ```bash
   zap.sh -daemon -config api.key=your-api-key
   ```

2. Run the security tests with the following command:
   ```bash
   python run_tests.py --target http://example.com
   ```

3. View the generated report at `reports/vulnerability_report.html`.

## How It Works

1. **ZAP Proxy Setup**: ZAP is configured to run in daemon mode, allowing it to be controlled programmatically via the API.
2. **Automated Scanning**: The framework uses ZAP's API to initiate scans on the provided target URLs. It automatically configures various scanning parameters to detect common vulnerabilities.
3. **Report Generation**: After the scan completes, a detailed report is generated, listing the discovered vulnerabilities along with their severity, potential impact, and remediation suggestions.
